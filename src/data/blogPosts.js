    content: `Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Key Concepts:
â€¢ Pods: The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes
â€¢ Deployments: Manage the desired state of your applications
â€¢ Services: Enable network access to your applications
â€¢ Namespaces: Organize and isolate resources

Getting Started:
1. Install kubectl (Kubernetes command-line tool)
2. Set up a local cluster with Minikube
3. Deploy your first application
4. Scale and manage your containers

Best Practices:
â€¢ Always use version control for your Kubernetes manifests
â€¢ Implement health checks for your containers
â€¢ Use resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion
â€¢ Keep your container images up to date`

    content: `DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery.

Core DevOps Practices:
â€¢ Continuous Integration (CI): Automatically build and test code changes
â€¢ Continuous Delivery (CD): Automate the release process
â€¢ Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Manage infrastructure using code
â€¢ Monitoring and Logging: Track application performance

Getting Started with DevOps:
1. Set up version control (Git)
2. Implement CI/CD pipelines
3. Use containerization (Docker)
4. Adopt infrastructure automation

Key DevOps Tools:
â€¢ Jenkins: For CI/CD automation
â€¢ Docker: For containerization
â€¢ Kubernetes: For container orchestration
â€¢ Terraform: For infrastructure as code

Best Practices:
â€¢ Automate everything possible
â€¢ Implement comprehensive testing
â€¢ Use version control for all code
â€¢ Monitor and measure everything
â€¢ Foster collaboration between teams`
